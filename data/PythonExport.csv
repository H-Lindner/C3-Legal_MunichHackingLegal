While it states the lease commencement date and duration of three years, it lacks a specific end date like 'until 31 December 2027'. Hence, it could be considered indefinite.","The clause requires the tenant to waive the termination rights for three years without providing justification such as major investment or renovation. This could be considered invalid if it binds the tenant for too long without proper justification.","no","Die Klausel zur Betriebskostenregelung ist zu vage formuliert.

However, the reference to 'the index that most closely corresponds' is vague and may be considered invalid without a clear definition of how this index will be determined."
